# Create a weather application using React

The project was developed using a range of exciting technologies such as JavaScript, React, Tailwind CSS, luxon, unicons, and react-toastify. With such a powerful combination of tools.

OpenWeather endpoints were used to fetch data for the project. Specifically, I retrieved temperature, max and min temperatures, humidity levels, real feel, sunrise and sunset times, as well as both hourly and daily forecasts. In addition, the local time for the selected location was displayed.
